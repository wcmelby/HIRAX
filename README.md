# HIRAX
This repository contains code and information related to the HIRAX narrowband optical filters. 
\\
Code to power the heaters, read RTD sensors, and manage one or three PID loops simultaneously can be found under __Arduino_Sketches__.
\\
Code related to using the HR4Pro spectrometer can be found under __Ocean_Insight__. Read_Spectrum.py has the most useful consoidated functions. You can also find the output spectral data and Jupyter notebook files for the data analysis. 
\\
While a PID temperature control loop is active, run the Live_Serial_Monitor.py to write the output to a CSV file.
